## <Hello folks\/> üëã

Hi! I am Jessica Lewinter, I'm 25 yo iOS Developer with 2.5 years of experience and I'm from Fortaleza-Brazil. I'm very passionate about creating mobile applications and it was in this field that my personal and professional projects were created. I love learning different things every day and also enjoy sharing my knowledge with the community.

### Technologies üë©‚Äçüíª
By now, I'm learning more about Architeture, Tests, Functional Programming and Reactive frameworks(like Combine).

### Some of my main projects üöÄ
#### [Komika](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/komika/id1444750258) 
Application developed for iPad, having children as a target audience. Provides an environment for developing creativity in children through comic books.
#### [Tidie](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/tidie/id1485569733)
This app has as main purpose to show the power that creating a habit can have in the environment that we live. With just a few minutes every day, our idea is that you get an organized and comfortable environment.
That way, you can spend more time exploring who you really are, being more productive and increase your well-being.

>**Note**

>The above projects were developed with my dear friends, that I like to call us Accio(or Zombie Team ü§î)
